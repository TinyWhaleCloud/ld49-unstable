# Hunk o' junk

## Meta
Game for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam with the topic "Unstable".

We made this game within 72 hours and using a game engine that we had never really used before.  
Making this game was a great learning experience. -Something you can see in how often code style has changed within the project.  
This whole weekend was very fun and we're probably going to be updating the game in the future.

## About the game

Set in the not so distant future in a very different parallel universe, you are a space cab driver.  
You have to transport passengers from planet to planet. The faster you are the better you are paid.  
However, the fastest routes are also the most dangerous since there are asteroid fields on them.

Can you survive in a space ship that is slowly falling apart with every small impact?  
What will you chose? A quick and fuel efficient ride or a safe one that is less profitable?

Just a small tip: You do not want to piss off the geese.
