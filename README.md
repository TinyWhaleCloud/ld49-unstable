# Hunk o' junk

Game for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam with the topic "Unstable". Something with space. 

We made this game within 72 hours and using a game engine that we had never really used before.  
Making this game was a great learning experience. -Something you can see in how often code style has changed within the project.  
This whole weekend was very fun and we're probably going to be updating the game in the future.
